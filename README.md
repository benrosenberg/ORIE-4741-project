Project description: 

This dataset is from MyAnimeList.net (Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist), a database somewhat like iMDB which allows people to record the anime (i.e., predominantly Japanese animated TV shows and movies) that they've watched. In our visualizations we used a CSV of user data, which includes names, gender, birth dates, join dates, locations, and more.
