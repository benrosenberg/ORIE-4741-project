Project description: 

Anime describes predominantly Japanese animated TV shows and movies, but anime viewership has skyrocketed around the world over the past decade. As such, our project aims to use demographic data (such as age, gender, and location) of anime viewers to predict their anime watchtime and favorite genres. Additionally, we want to be able to predict how a user will rate a given anime based on their demographics, as well as ratings of similar anime in the past. 

Although this project may seem like it's "just for fun," the prediction algorithms generated here could prove useful for titans in the anime industry. Being able to predict how much different demographics watch anime, which types of anime they like, and how they rate anime can be quite informative when deciding to launch a new show or movie.

Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó:nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó:nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó:nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó:nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters.
